# RMD Template

Let's load the `knitr` library and set the working directory:

```{R}
# Load library
library(knitr)

## Set working directory
setwd(".")
```

Let's read `test.R`

```{R}
read_chunk('test.R')
<<workdir>>
```

Let's execute something without outputting to script:

```{R, echo = FALSE}
<<helloworld>>
```

And without outputting anything:

```{R, include = FALSE}
<<helloworld>>
```
